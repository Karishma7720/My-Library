The Book Library isn't really customizable yet, but it will be. Its data is generated from src/BooksAPI.js API file, this file is retrieving the data by fetching this URL https://reactnd-books-api.udacity.com . This can be customizable if you replaced the api variable with your own custom API URL, but make sure that it doesn't conflict with the current scripts.
